    <p1>Hello - Tommy here! I am North Carolina raised, currently living in Minneapolis. If you are wondering why I left the South to move to FREEZING COLD Minnesota, I am asking myself the same question. It probably had something to do with my girlfriend Erin - who is from the area. We just bought a house and live with our doggo, Remy.  We enjoy doting on Remy daily and making sure she knows she is the best dog in the world. Other interests include music, movies (anxiously waiting to find out Rey's parents), traveling, CrossFit and food tours. </p1>

        I have been in the fitness industry for the last 10 years working as a personal trainer and head programmer for CrossFit affiliates. My certifications include: CrossFit Level 3, Precision Nutrition, USAW Weightlifting and Kettlebell Instructor.  This has been a rewarding career working with people of walks of life to improve their health and happiness. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by enrolling in a Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. My hope is to transition into a new career as a full stack developer.
