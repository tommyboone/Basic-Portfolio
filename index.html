    <p1>Originally from North Carolina, I’ve lived in Minnesota for the last 2 years. I’ve been on a couple of different career paths, most recently spending the last 9 years in the fitness industry. Prior to that, I attended a culinary school close to home and quickly realized after finishing school that commercial kitchens were not for me. I’m excited to be a part of this program and can’t wait to learn the skills that will help me in this field!</p1>

            In my free time, I like to play music, watch movies, hang out with my girlfriend Erin and our dog, Remy, exercise, and food tour around the city.
